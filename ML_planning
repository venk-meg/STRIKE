First Steps:
Gather 5 seconds of ALL actions --> plot them --> see what channels / data you want to work with 
(mean variance etc ... simplify separate channels into unified information)

-- also just record plain actions first before thinking of whether one action leads into the other

Figure out time resolution for gesture detection/ pipleline

Figure out simple ML model Tensorflow, Keras ... KNN, Decision Tree etc. etc. do more research (train on computer export to TFlite
for microcontroller)

test working + improve

add FSM framework and test within that
